* natsukashii 懐かしい

/*natsukashii* -- nostalgic, reminiscent of good memories, something that is yearned for./

Natsukashii is an automated web archive scraper for fanfiction.net which is
designed to find stories which have been deleted from the site a long, long time
foo ago, to save them from being lost forever.

This is a pet project. I made it because /I/ care about some of these stories, and
becauce I remember them from decades ago and want to read them again. If you
like this and find it useful as well, that's awesome.

This project is very much a work in progress and will change all the time (or
whenever I have time working on it, at least).
